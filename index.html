                <strong>Context</strong><br>
                Grocery stores have lots of products - can be difficult to find items and navigate layout.<br>
                Overwhelming amounts of information<br>
                Best route for items can be challenging<br>
                <strong>Target domain</strong><br>
                Grocery shoppers with visual impairments, anxiety, or indecision<br>
                <strong>Our App</strong><br>
                An app to be used in a grocery store<br>
                Inform the user how to navigate the store<br>
                Helps them reach their desired items<br>
                <strong> Problem Statements</strong><br>
                As a shopper who is new to this grocery store, I struggle to figure out where items are.<br>
                As a shopper who is visually impaired, I struggle to read the aisle signs to figure out where the items I need are.<br>
                As a new employee at the store, I struggle to direct customers to where their desired product is located.<br>

        <h1>Peer Feedback Insights</h1>
        <flexy>
        <textBox>
        <p>
            <strong>Positive</strong><br>
            Peers enjoyed the layout and information in the slide deck<br>
            Many people thought the idea would be potentially beneficial to them, as it would save time when grocery shopping or provide directions in unfamiliar stores<br>
            The map visuals were detailed and it was easy to see the route provided through the store<br>
            The scope of the product was reasonable and could be used by a large domain of shoppers<br>
            App helps customers save and spend less by allowing them to have a clear route and plan<br>
            
            <strong>Negative</strong><br>
            Lack of incentive for customers to provide feedback<br>
            Audience for product may not be broad enough<br>
            May not be useful to customers already familiar with the store<br>
            Malicious users could potentially skew data within the feedback section of the app <br>
            Prototype could have been more developed<br>

            <strong>Knowledge Gained from Peer Feedback</strong><br>Overall our feedback was mainly positive, with users stating they would use the app and that it is a great solution to the problem of finding items in a grocery store. Our feedback on accessibility was also positive, and in the future, we should mainly focus on allowing the customization of visual elements such as font size and dark mode. Negative feedback mainly focused on the UI sometimes feeling cluttered and the app's reliance on accurate user feedback.<br> We also noticed most of our users stated they were unlikely to use the audio features to guide them through the store, making this an area we could look to improve by finding ways to integrate audio in less intrusive ways.

        <flexy>
        <textBox>
        <p>
            <strong>Potential Upcoming Developments</strong><br>A few users provided valuable suggestions for future improvements to add and some potential pitfalls of the products, which would be key areas to focus on in later releases of our product. One of the main areas to work on would be adding support for this app to as many stores as possible. We could also work with stores on a case-by-case basis to see if they would be willing to provide coupons or discounts to users who provide feedback and make the app more accurate. We also could look to implement safeguards against users submitting incorrect information. This could be done by giving each user a feedback accuracy rating that shifts on whether future customers find their information to be accurate, and time out users from providing feedback when their rating gets too low. For our product to be successful, we would need to continue to improve the functionality, accuracy, and availability of the app.
